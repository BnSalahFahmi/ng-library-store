# Ng Library Store Application

> Ng Library Store is a sample prototype that uses Spring Boot and Angular 8 to organize books into different libraries.

Technology Stack :
* Angular 8
* NgRx : redux implementation for angular apps. 
* Spring Boot
* Axon 4 (CQRS architecture / Event Sourcing)

## Development server

First of all you need to install dependencies for both client and server.

Run `npm install` in the root folder of the project to install client dependencies.

After installing the dependencies you should be able to run the application locally by following these steps : 

* Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to launch the server

* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
